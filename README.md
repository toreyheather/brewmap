My Code Louisville JavaScript/React project is a web app that allows users create a list of breweries they would like to visit along with a list of breweries they have already visited. These lists are created with breweries pulled from the Open Brewery Database. Users are able to search the Open Brewery Database through a search form in the app. The search will pull up any breweries that match the search field and then the user can clinic a button to add those breweries to their wishlist or visited list. If a brewery is added to a list by mistake or needs to be removed for another reason, the breweries can be removed from the wishlist or visited route. 

This project uses the npm package manager. To run the app navigate to the project directory and enter "npm start" and the app with open in it's own localhost.
